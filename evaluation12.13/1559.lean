  -- First, note that φ(P) is a subgroup since φ is an automorphism
  have h1 : IsSubgroup (φ '' P.toSubgroup) := by
    -- This follows from the fact that automorphisms preserve subgroup structure
    sorry

  -- Since P is a p-Sylow subgroup, |P| = pⁿ for some n
  have h2 : ∃ n, P.toSubgroup.card = p ^ n := by
    -- This follows from the definition of Sylow subgroups
    sorry

  -- For any automorphism φ, we know that |φ(P)| = |P| (automorphisms preserve order)
  have h3 : (φ '' P.toSubgroup).card = P.toSubgroup.card := by
    -- This follows from the fact that bijections preserve cardinality
    sorry

  -- Therefore, φ(P) is also a p-Sylow subgroup
  have h4 : IsSylow p (φ '' P.toSubgroup) := by
    -- This follows from the preserved cardinality and the definition of Sylow subgroups
    sorry

  -- Since P is normal in G (given by hypothesis), P is the unique p-Sylow subgroup
  have h5 : ∀ Q : Subgroup G, IsSylow p Q → Q = P.toSubgroup := by
    -- This follows from the uniqueness of normal Sylow subgroups
    sorry

  -- Therefore, φ(P) = P as P is the unique p-Sylow subgroup
