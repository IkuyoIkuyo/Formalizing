1) First, we start with the given equations:
   * We have xy = 1 (hypothesis h1)
   * We have zx = 1 (hypothesis h2)

2) Now, let's multiply the equation zx = 1 on the right by y:
   * (zx)y = 1y
   * z(xy) = y (using associativity of multiplication)
   * z1 = y (using h1: xy = 1)
   * z = y

3) Therefore, y = z
