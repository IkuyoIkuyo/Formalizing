1) Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that F is a finite algebraically closed field.

2) Since F is finite, it has a finite number of elements, say n elements.

3) Consider the polynomial p(x) = Π(i in F) (x - i) and q(x) = p(x) + 1 in F[x].

4) As F is algebraically closed, q(x) must have a root in F, let's call it a.

5) This means q(a) = 0.

6) But since a is an element in F, one of the term in the product p(a) = Π(i in F) (a - i) is (a - a) = 0. Thus the whole product p(a) = 0.

7) Thus q(a) = p(a) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, our assumption that F is finite must be false. Thus, an algebraically closed field must be infinite.
